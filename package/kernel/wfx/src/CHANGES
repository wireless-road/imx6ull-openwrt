Changes in 2.7
--------------

  * Improve QoS when bus is slow.
  * Add a section in the README about possible scheduling improvements when the
    CPU of the host is slow.

Changes in 2.6.2
----------------

  * TKIP/CCMP replay protection is now fully enabled. It may cause some
    bandwidth drop down with firmware older than 3.11.
  * Fix reporting of MMIC errors. The frames with MMIC errors were dropped to
    early and the EAP session was not renegotiated as expected.
  * Fix documentation about nl80211 interface

Changes in 2.6.1
----------------

  * Fix process error during delivery of release 2.6

Changes in 2.6 (not released)
-----------------------------

  * Module parameters 'gpio_reset' and 'gpio_wakeup' are not supported
    anymore. These variables were considered obsolete by the mainstream. User
    has to deal with Device Tree.
  * Powersave is now enabled by default. There is no more impact of powersave on
    Rx bandwidth for a while.
  * Add a workaround for the error 'timeout while wake up chip'.
    (WHIFER_FW-1442)
  * Secure link does not accept unexpected unencrypted packets anymore (only for
    API >= 3.4).
  * Fix support for sending of protected multicast management frames.
    (IPWHIFER-636)
  * Fix potential race during interface initialization.
  * Allow to scan while acting as an AP. The firmware support this feature but
    it was unfairly disabled in the driver.

Changes in 2.5.2
----------------

  * Fix BlockAck negotiation when the device is AP and MFP is enabled. This fix
    support for WPA3. (IPWHIFER-627)
  * Fix BlockAck negotiation when MFP is disabled but BSS is MFP capable.
    (IPWHIFER-229)

Changes in 2.5.1
----------------

  * Fix potential failure during firmware loading. The bug was introduced in
    2.5.

Changes in 2.5
--------------

  * Enable A-MDPU reordering. This change relies on the BlockAck sessions
    forwarded by the firmware. The firmware API < 3.4 don't forward this
    information and cannot benefit of this feature (IPWHIFER-409)
  * Enable TKIP/CCMP replay protection in kernel < 4.3. This change relies on
    A-MPDU reordering. It will cause a performance hit on firmware API < 3.4.
    This change will be also applied to kernel >= 4.3 in a next version of the
    driver. (IPWHIFER-410)
  * Fix potential wrong TIM value when a station fall asleep (IPWHIFER-561,
    IPWHIFER-590)
  * Introduce nl80211 vendor interface with these commands:
     - burn anti-rollback bit (IPWHIFER-586)
     - change the PTA settings (IPWHIFER-576, IPWHIFER-573)
  * Add way to force FastPs mode and duration from debugfs (IPWHIFER-587)
  * When using combo with a firmware >= 3.8, enable FastPS (PS-Poll was
    preferred until now)
  * Fix interfaces balancing while using combo mode (IPWHIFER-616)
  * The file "tx_power_loop", in debugfs, provides an access to the status of
    the amplifier for the calibration process.
  * Load the firmware a little faster:
      - in 64ms instead of 130ms using SDIO bus
      - in 78ms instead of 115ms using SPI bus
  * Improve robusteness against malformed HIF messages

    dumped (IPWHIFER-596)
  * Fix support for Out-Of-Band IRQ when using SDIO bus (IOTPA_WIFI-286)
  * Allow to use edge or level triggered IRQs (in SPI or in SDIO OOB). This can
    be defined in device tree. If nothing is specified (or if IRQ controller
    doesn't report trigger correctly), use level IRQ. You can check the
    configuration in /proc/interrupts.
  * Support for new Suspend/Resume indication sent for firmware 3.5 when chip
    is too hot (IPWHIFER-591)
  * Improve output of the file "counters" in debugfs. It now shows counters for
    all interfaces. It also displays not yet named counters.
  * In combo mode, legacy PS is automatically enabled. Now, it also
    automatically switches to FastPS if AP does not support legacy PS
    (IPWHIFER-588)
  * Drop the prefix "WFX_" from driver version (displayed in dmesg and in
    /sys/module/wfx/version)
  * In combo mode, greatly improve bandwidth if both interfaces use same channel
    PS is not enforced anymore. (IPWHIFER-485)

    (IPWHIFER-376)
  * Driver does not follow short_frame_max_tx_count and long_frame_max_tx_count
    anymore. These properties should be take into account by mac80211. This
    change improve upstream TCP throughput.
  * Clean up and improvement of Rate Control algorithm (aka minstrel
    algorithm). Also add sanity checks in received Tx confirmations.
    Improvements in noisy environments are expected (IPWHIFER-408,
    IPWHIFER-341)
  * Previous item should also fix SGI usage in corner cases (IPWHIFER-323)
  * IBSS works now (IPWHIFER-88, IPWHIFER-480)

    Tx performances.
  * Re-work IRQ handling and device wake up process (IPWHIFER-264, IPWHIFER-284):
       - fix periodic (every 10sec) wake up of chip (IPWHIFER-349)
       - fix race condition between control register and IRQ (IPWHIFER-420,
         IPWHIFER-330)
       - fix potential race condition between wake_up interrupt and data_ready
         interrupt (IPWHIFER-433)
       - use new wake-up notification mechanism introduced in API 1.4 (supported
         by not-yet-released firmware 2.3)
  * Check if access to control register from SPI is valid and recover error
    if not (IPWHIFER-420).
  * SPI bus is now configured to use MODE2 of Ineo chipset. Byte swapping
    before/after SPI bus access is no more necessary (IPWHIFER-368,
    IPWHIFER-416).
  * Device now shut down when unbinded (IPWHIFER-442)
  * Remove support for monitor mode since it has never worked (IPWHIFER-378).
  * Remove support for /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/wfx/wsm_params. It was a
    hack and was never really used.
  * Start to clean up API and synchronize it with firmware (IPWHIFER-369).
  * Improve tolerance to firmware freeze.
  * Normal users are now allowed to access counters, rx_stats and status.
    However, user have to access to debugfs itself. Administrators have to run:

  * Support for secondary interface (aka "combo mode") is now proposed as
    in-development preview.

Changes in 2.1.2
----------------

  * Driver included a workaround for Raspberry SPI driver described here: [1].
    However, it was not enabled. This release improve this workaround and
    enable it when necessary.
  * In internal versions, testmode did not return correct error code

[1]: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/2200

Changes in 2.1.1
----------------

  * Show firmware keyset in startup banner
  * Update testmode API in internal versions

Changes in 2.1
--------------

  * Driver does not accept power_mode parameter anymore. Chip power save mode
    is now set dynamically using native Linux API. So, command below is
    equivalent to power_mode=0:
        iw dev wlan set power_save off
    Enabling power_save is equivalent to power_mode=2 if wakeup_gpio is defined
    (in DT).  Else, if wakeup_gpio is not defined, it is equivalent to
    power_mode=1.
  * Driver tries now to load a firmware with keyset in its name (i.e.
    wfm_wf200_C0.sec). If it is not found, it fallbacks to legacy firmware name
    (wfm_wf200.sec). This feature allows installing firmware for multiple chips
    alongside.
  * Testmode was removed from public releases. Indeed, driver relied on
    NL80211_TESTMODE but did not provide any useful testmode commands.
  * Uniformize debug traces
  * Fix race condition during chip identification on SPI
  * Scan now waits longer for AP response
  * Fix UAPSD that was broken since 2.0
  * Fix listening mode (that created an unsolicited AP)
  * Fix some errors pointed by checkpatch.pl

Changes in 2.0.3
----------------

  * Show power_mode value in debugfs (in
    /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/wfx/status)
  * Show rx_stats in debugfs (in /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/wfx/rx_stats)
  * Improve concurrency robustness while removing interface
  * Fix support for DTIM > 1s
  * Fix support for development hardware

Changes in 2.0.2
----------------

  * Improve README content and Markdown rendering
  * The revision 2.0.1 does not exists because of a tagging error

Changes in 2.0
--------------

    incompatible with firmwares < 2.0
  * New architecture for API handling
  * API error handling improvements
  * CHANGES and README files are now in public release
  * Fix multiple timing issues in AP when stations enable power saving
  * Fix compatibility with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
  * Fix possible race conditions during chip initialization
  * Fix issue with Short GI negotiation. Short GI was not enabled even if
    remote support it

  * Fix issue with HT features. HT features was not always reset between
    sessions
  * Report error if configured MTU is not supported (> 1500 bytes)

Changes in 1.6
--------------

  * Fix maximum bitrate in IBSS mode
  * Show interface id in traces

    described in README. YOU HAVE TO UPDATE YOUR DEVICE TREE (IPWHIFER-275,
    IPWHIFER-274)
  * Driver is now packed in one module named wfx.ko. Module aliases allow to
    provide a bit compatibility but this change may break external processes.
  * MAC address is fetched from chip OTP memory. macadress module parameter
    does not exist anymore. It is possible to change macadress using standard
    Linux tools (or DT). Notice you need firmware >= 1.2.13 to make this work
    properly
  * Allow to use an external IRQ pin instead of SDIO native one (not yet
    supported by firmware)
  * Drop wfx_refclk module parameter
  * Drop bssloss_mitigation module parameter
  * Drop wfx_ba_*x_tids module parameters
